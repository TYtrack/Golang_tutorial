The master pings every worker periodically. If no response is received
from a worker in a certain amount of time, the master marks the worker
as failed. Any map tasks completed by the worker are reset back to their
initial idle state and therefore become eligible for scheduling on other
workers. Similarly, any map task or reduce task in progress on a failed
worker is also reset to idle and becomes eligible for rescheduling.
Completed map tasks are reexecuted on a failure because their output is stored on the local disk(s) of the failed machine and is therefore
inaccessible. Completed reduce tasks do not need to be reexecuted
since their output is stored in a global file system.
